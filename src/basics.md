## Technical Details
Here are some nice technical details to know:

Blackstone may occasionally "panic". This is because it is written in Rust. 
If your Blackstone compiler panics, send us the following on the Discord:
- What code you gave it
- The panic error & stacktrace.

If you believe an error is not helpful, please let us know on the Discord. We want to make Blackstone as friendly of a programming language as possible for developers.
